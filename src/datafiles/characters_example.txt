This example shows how different characters in the dialogue system work.
[e:waving]gmdialogue[e:] has two characters built-in: default one and Mr. Rectangle
[chr:rectangle]Hi!
[chr:default]Both characters are stored in the dialogue_set_character.
global.mapcharacters is used to assign string used in tags to the actual values.
So new characters are added by setting up values in the dialogue_set_character and when adding a value in the global.mapcharacters.
